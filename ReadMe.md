yamlstar
========

A cross-language, common API YAML reference framework

# Description

The YAMLStar project has a goal of properly implementing complete and fully
compatible YAML frameworks in all of the most popular programming languages.
These frameworks are intended to be published under the name YAMLStar on each
languages packaging system.

YAMLStar gets its name from the `*` (star) character and its intent to mean
_any_.
Think `yaml.*` => `yaml.rb`, `yaml.java`, `yaml.rs` etc...

YAMLStar will specify a common usage API and attempt to implement the API in a
manner that is natural to each target programming language.

Where possible each framework implementation builds over libfyaml.
